# IntervalBinarySearchTrees



This is a part of my Diploma thesis.
It shows a data structure called Interval Trees.
The base of the Interval Tree is Binary Search Tree

Queries require O(log n + m) time, with n being the total number of intervals and m being the number of reported results. 
Construction requires O(n log n) time, and storage requires O(n) space.
